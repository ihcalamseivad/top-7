    <p>Basketball is a fast-paced and thrilling sport that captivates millions around the globe. Originating in the late 19th century, it has evolved into a game characterized by its high-energy play, strategic team coordination, and remarkable athleticism. Played on a rectangular court with a hoop at each end, the objective is to score points by shooting the ball through the opponent's basket. Basketball requires not only physical skills like speed, agility, and jumping ability but also sharp mental acuity for quick decision-making and strategic planning. The sport has a profound cultural impact, especially in countries like the United States, where leagues like the NBA showcase some of the world's most talented athletes. Iconic players, from Michael Jordan to LeBron James, have elevated the game, inspiring countless fans and young athletes. Basketball's universal appeal is further cemented by its accessibility, played in professional arenas, schools, parks, and driveways worldwide, making it a truly global sport.</p>
